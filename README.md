# MidnightModpack

This modpack aims to enhance the immersion of The Midnight Mod!

### About:
Midnight Modpack aims to improve the stability of The Midnight Mod and drastically increase performance. It utilizes FoamFix as its main method of improving performance. On the other hand, it contains mods such as Neat and Apple Skin/Core to improve the qualities of life in Minecraft.

### Why should I download this modpack?
This modpack adds a new dimension, known as The Midnight. If you ever wanted a new dimension that still kept a semi-vanilla feel whilst adding additional features and life, then this is the modpack for you!

### Why shouldn't I just download the mod?
You should always support the original mod author(s) whenever possible. With this modpack, however, it aims to expand the use of the mod, alongside vanilla features, making the mod blend with the vanilla world.

**All documentation of The Midnight Mod can be found [here](https://the-midnight-mod.fandom.com/wiki/The_Midnight_mod_Wiki).**
